            At PassLock, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by PassLock and how we use it.<br><br>
            
            If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.<br><br>
            Information We Collect<br><br>
            
            The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.<br><br>
            
            If you choose to use our App, PassLock, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:<br><br>
            - Email address<br>
            - Master password<br><br>
            
            The information that we collect will be used to contact or identify you. Please note, your master password is encrypted and never stored in plain text.
            How We Use Your Information<br><br>
            
            We use the information we collect in various ways, including to:<br><br>
            - Provide, operate, and maintain our app<br>
            - Improve, personalize, and expand our app<br>
            - Understand and analyze how you use our app<br>
            - Develop new products, services, features, and functionality<br><br>
            Log Files<br><br>
            
            PassLock follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log users when they use apps. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, device type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
            Security of Your Information<br><br>

            Your passwords are encrypted using CryptoKit with symmetric keys. An encryption key generated from your master password, along with a random salt, ensures that your data remains secure. This encryption key is stored on Firebase in an encrypted form and is never transmitted or stored in plain text.<br><br>

            We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.<br><br>
